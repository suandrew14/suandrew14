## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently upskilling my data, machine learning and programming skills.
I am putting together a data analytics portfolio and eventually a data science portfolio.
I am currently learning: SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, R, Python ML packages and Cloud tools. 

In the future I may add other personal projects to this github.
